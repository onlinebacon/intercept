			<h2>How the Intercept Console works</h2>
			<p>
				The Intercept Console allows you to add the necessary information to build lines of position
				and solve for the most likely pair of coordinates that matches them.</p>
			<p>
				For a line of position to be added, at least two of this pieces of information have to be specified:
				a geographical position and an angle reading.
				Everytime an angle reading is added a new line of position will be build that matches
				this reading for the last geographical position input.
			</p>
			<h2>Commands</h2>
			<p>The commands take one line, starting with the command's name, followed by a colon and the command's arguments.</p>
			<p>You can find a list of commands that can be used to build the lines of position an solve for the intercept below.</p>
